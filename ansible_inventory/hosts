# KVM host groups
# Purpose: 
#   KVM(Kernel Virtual Machine) hosts.  Lets just call them
#   virtualization hosts.  
#   Because I play with a lot of technologies to simulate on-premises
#   environments it is more suitable for my electric bill and wallet
#   to minimize costs in hardware by virtualizing some workloads. 
#   OpenStack or Kubernetest worker nodes on my lab do run on baremetal nodes
#   which are not listed on this inventory since those are managed via their own
#   respective lifecycle managers.
